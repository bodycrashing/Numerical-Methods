----------- Plain Monte Carlo Integration WITHOUT Multi Threading -------------

Integration of gamma function from 0 to Pi:
Error = 0.00241883
Result: Q=1.39093
Correct result: Q_exact=1.39320392968568
Time spend WITHOUT Multi threading: 4.1824 seconds 

----------- Plain Monte Carlo Integration WITH Multi Threading -------------

Integration of gamma function from 0 to Pi:
Error = 0.00264859
Result: Q=1.39177
Correct result: Q_exact=1.39320392968568
Time spend WITH Multi threading: 4.75867 seconds 

As is evident from the results the multi-threaded version of the plain
Monte Carlo integration actually takes long time tothan the ordinary implementation.
I have tested other students implentation on my Macbook and in all cases the multithreaded
are slower. In other words it seems that the time it takes to allocate the 'workers'
is greater than time gained by actual multithreading.
